# Crazyflie learning guide

The Crazyflie learning guide is a starter software for crazyflie 2.0 quadcopters and the loco positioning system.

The communication to the crazyflie bases on cflib:
cflib is an API written in Python that is used to communicate with the Crazyflie
and Crazyflie 2.0 quadcopters. It is intended to be used by client software to
communicate with and control a Crazyflie quadcopter. For instance the Crazyflie PC [cfclient] client uses the cflib.
